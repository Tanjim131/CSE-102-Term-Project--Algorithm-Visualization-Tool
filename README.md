# CSE-102-Term-Project--Algorithm-Visualization-Tool
This was my first term project. We did this project back in L1-T1. For the graphics part, we used iGraphics Library. We designed a simple algorithm visualization tool that simulates Sieve of Eranthoses and Bubble Sort. My project partner was Tanjim Munir Dipon (1505083). Our project supervisor was Kaysar Abdullah.
